# DS-Lab-Sem-2-AY-2020-21
Consists my submissions for Data Structures Lab (C language) for Sem 2 Ay 2020-21

1. merge_quick.c - Write a program in C to implement Merge and Quick Sort using Structure array.
2. pre_in_final.c - Write a program to convert a given Prefix expression into its equivalent Infix expression and evaluate it using stack.
3. a. linked_list_try1.c - WAP to store at most 10 digit integers in a Singly linked list and perform arithmetic operations on it. (Solved using only 1 list, stores 2 numbers and using pow() to convert these numbers to long and then operates on it using pre-defined operators.)
b.  linked_list.c - WAP to store at most 10 digit integers in a Singly linked list and perform arithmetic operations on it. (Solved using 2 lists and a separate list to store result, and does addition-subtraction using carry and borrow on digits.)
4. tree_for_shop.c - You have to maintain information for a shop owner. For each of the products sold in his/hers shop the following information is kept: 
a unique code, a name, a price, amount in stock, date received, expiration date. 
For keeping track of its stock, the clerk would use a computer program based on a search tree data structure. Write a program to help this person, by implementing the following operations:
• Insert an item with all its associated data. 
• Find an item by its code, and support updating of the item found. 
• List valid items in lexicographic order of their names.
5. avl_tree.c - WAP for AVL Tree to implement the following operations: (For nodes as integers). Insertion: Test program for all cases (LL, RR, RL, LR rotation).
6. a. graph3.c - Write a C program to accept a directed weighted graph from user and represent it with Adjacency Matrix and find a shortest distance from source to destination using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
b. graph.c - Write a C program to accept a directed weighted graph from user and represent it with Adjacency Matrix and find a shortest distance from source to destination using Dijkstra’s algorithm. (Has multiple smaller tries, that didn't work. needs debugging.)
